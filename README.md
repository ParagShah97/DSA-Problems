- Arrays and Strings
- Trees and Graphs
- Linked Lists
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching

## 📁 Structure

Each file or folder will correspond to a problem, and include:
- Problem statement (in comments or linked)
- Approach/intuition
- Code implementation

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- To track my coding journey
